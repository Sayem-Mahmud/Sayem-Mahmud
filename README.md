Asif Iqbal Munna



Hi there, I am Asif Iqbal Munna, a MERN Stack Developer, having a vast interest to work with technology and eagerness to know more made my way of learning smoother hopefully it will continuously improve. I always want to learn by doing and get enough experience to be a senior Web Developer.
Technologies I Know: Comfortable : JavaScript, ES6, React Js, React Router, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap

Familiar: Express Js, Node Js, MongoDB, Material UI, Tailwind CSS, React Bootstrap, SCSS, TypeScript, WordPress, Elementor.

Tools: Git, VS Code, Netlify, Firebase, Figma, Heroku, Chrome Dev Tool

How I Code: I always try to divide my work into small pieces. Remain cautious about maintaining dry principle, manageable code, frequent commit, making comments whenever applicable and most importantly try to follow community best practices while writing code.

Some projects are done by me. I used previously mentioned technologies and essential libraries and packages for those projects. They are linked down to the "Projects" part.

So, now I am looking forward to getting an internship or job opportunity in your organization where I can sharpen my skills and will be able to learn more to fit best at my position.
